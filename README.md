## About

This work was inspired by old computer games like nethack. It's built on a similar map making algorithm that creates generative rooms linked together with corridors. I switched this to an isometric view and had multiple levels generated. A modern retro CRT-monitor inspired collection.

Also the first tokens created on fxhash from an on-chain project, making this the third first-project to use a new fxhash feature.

## Running

The files you need are...

```

...spin up a local webserver or just opening index.html should do the trick, see instructions.md for, well, instructions.
